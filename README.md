# emergency_vehicle_detection
##The main goal is to detect emergency vehicle(ambulance and fire fighter truck) along with the bounding box

##The main database of kaggle's https://www.kaggle.com/abhisheksinghblr/emergency-vehicles-identification has some limitations. Because there were no bounding boxes

For finding the bounding box I with my friend, @Carbodose applied yolov4 pre-trained model that is applied in MS_COCO Dataset.. The darknet reporsitory was downloaded first then the image.c file was changed. It was quite challenging.  


This poroject is done followed by these awesome tutorials>>>
